speckit/specify create a java application to validate given jwt token against a jwks url, and tell the user what is the result, its valid or invalid.
speckit/plan use java 17 to build this application, and use maven as project build tool.
speckit/clarify when access the jwks, i need to provide jwks url from command line
speckit/clarify user will need to provider 3 parameter: jwks url, the x-gtwy-client-id value and the token from command line

speckit.clarify when maven build the jar, all library referenced need to be packed into the jar
speckit.clarify during the token validation, the application need to also print out the following information: token headers, token claims, which key is used to verify the token

speckit.implement





here is the case, i have a microservice, this microservicec expose 5 operations, each operation will invoke different method on the same backend. and when invoke backend, an authorization header is required. this token can be shared among those operation handlers, and token can expire after some time. if token not exist, microservice need to call a token service to get one, when token will get expired, the microserevice will have to call token service to refresh token. give me a good solution to maintain the token in this microservice.
